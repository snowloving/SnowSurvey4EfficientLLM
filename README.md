## 📌 Overview

`SnowSurvey4EfficientLLM` is a systematic literature repository focusing on **efficiency in Large Language Models** (LLMs). It covers the entire lifecycle of LLM efficiency – from architectural innovations and model compression to inference acceleration, training optimization, routing strategies, evaluation benchmarks, and open‑source tooling.

This repository is designed for:
- **Researchers** looking for a structured entry point into efficient LLM literature.
- **Engineers** seeking practical optimization techniques and production‑ready tools.
- **Students** wanting to understand the landscape of LLM efficiency.
